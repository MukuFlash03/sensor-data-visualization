2. Failed to solve: error from sender: open /pgdata/pgdata: permission denied

3. Is the docker daemon running?
Error: Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. 

$ docker info
$ open /Applications/Docker.app


4. App container exited: No module named instructions

- Need to remove webapp as well since package is already defined to be "webapp" when using find_packages('webapp')


5. Many errors while setting up Docker for web app.

Exposing port to internet from within inside Docker; But this is already done in compose.yaml
Needed to connect the two Docker containers


Had to add few packages to Dockerfile: libpq-dev gcc

6. Table names -> '/' not allowed.
Had to use '''query "names with illegal chars" '''
