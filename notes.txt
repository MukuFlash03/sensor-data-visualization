1. Checking PostgreSQL DB setup

- Sign in as DB root admin
    $ sudo -u postgres psql
- Check users
    $ \du
- Check DBs
    $ \l


2. Creating DB for Project

- Sign out, exit to terminal
- Create DB
    $ createdb arkbiotech -O mukuflash
- Sign in as DB root admin
    $ sudo -u postgres psql
- Assign Privileges to DB for user 
    $ GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE arkbiotech TO mukuflash;

  

3. What to do with Dockerfile and compose.yaml

- ChatGPT says to build and run container using:
    $ docker compose up
- Docker Engine, Docker CLI, Docker Compose Plugin must already be installed for this command to run successfully.
- Working in MacOS VSCode; wasn't configured correctly on my Linux laptop.


4. Entry Points
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0k6zP_Lto

$ pip3 install -e /Users/mukuflash/Documents/ArkBiotech/webdash/

Then run commands defined in setup.py:
$ run-app
$ webdash-run

5. This was working in local environment but not inside Docker container.
For some reason, using ChatGPT's sample file which was similar to my setup.py worked.
Difference was that all packages and folders had same name, I guess.

6. Docker cache wasn't being cleared.
Used three commands in succession to clean, rebuild Docker containers.
$ docker compose build; docker compose down; docker compose up


7. Set up a Basic Flask server (hello world)
Working great.

8. Connection to DB inside Docker container
- Needed to establish or test whether connection existed between the two docker containers (app, Postgres)


9. Which plotting library to use
Matplotlib, plotly, dash, streamline
